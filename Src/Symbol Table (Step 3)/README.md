Please make sure that ANTLR is on the CLASSPATH

Please make sure that Micro.sh is executable

Directory should look like the following:

	inputs (directory)
	outputs (directory)
	Driver.java
	Grading_Script.sh
	Gram.g4
	Micro.sh
	README

If there is an error with running Micro.sh,
please first try recreating the file within
the Linux testing machine. We have several
times run into an error where Micro.sh will
not run on the lab machines if Micro.sh was
written on a Windows machine. Recreating the
file character for character on the lab
machines fixes this issue.

Please reach out to us if there are any other
issues you run into.

Thank you very much for reading me!
