Thank you for reading me.

Our script file "Micro.sh" assumes that javac and the antlr jar are on the Path.

It first runs antlr on our grammar file, "g.g4"

It then compiles our java file, "Driver.java"

From that point, it runs Driver using whatever file you give it

It then sends its output to "output.txt" for you to compare with the correct output.

Please make sure that all files, Driver.java, g.g4, any input files, etc., are all in the same 
directory.

Please run the script as:	"bash Micro.sh <inputFile>"

For example, "bash Micro.sh nested.micro"
