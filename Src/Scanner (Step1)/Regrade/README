This is the folder of our regrading material.

Micro.sh is modified to work on Linux machines and to correctly compile ANTLR files.

g.g4 is modified to no longer have a warning.

Driver.java is modified to properly handle line reading on all machines.

Grading_Script.sh is modified to work for our files.

Process:

Install ANTLR4 and add it to the CLASSPATH.

Put all files in one directory as such:

	inputs/			(directory)
	outputs/		(directory)
	Driver.java		(file)
	g.g4			(file)
	Grading_Script.sh	(file)
	Micro.sh		(file)
	README			(file)

Change Grading_Script.sh and Micro.sh to be executable.

Run $ ./Grading_Script.sh.
