# Compilers CSCI 468

This is a project repository for our Compilers capstone course. There are 4 different steps to creating our compiler, detailed below in seperate documentation. Read each documentation as you need to!

The Code Generation directory contains our most up-to-date code, and is the final product of this semester-long project.

In order to utilize this code you will need to have ANTLR.v4 installed on your machine and added to the CLASSPATH. You will also need Java installed in order to compile our source code.
